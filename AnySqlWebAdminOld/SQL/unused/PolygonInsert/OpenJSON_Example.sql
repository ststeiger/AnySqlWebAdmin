	-- If you're using SQL Server... It's worth noting that a precision of 1-9 uses 5 bytes. 
	-- So you may was well use a decimal(9,6) instead of decimal(7,4) 
	-- and take advantage of the higher accuracy since they both occupy the same amount of space. 
	-- Ten or more decimal places indicates a computer or calculator was used 
	-- and that no attention was paid to the fact that the extra decimals are useless. 
	-- Be careful, because unless you are the one reading these numbers off the device, 
	-- this can indicate low quality processing !
